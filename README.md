# Quarto

This project is currently in **Alpha** Development and is a personal passion project. Currently, I am working on this project alone to gain experience as a Product Designer and a Developer.

This project has no monetary intent and the code will be freely available to everyone for the foreseeable future.

I'm really excited to be working on this project and hope to see a few features be added over time.

Currently, local play seems to be "working". At the time of this writing "working" means that you can run this on your local machine and play multiple rounds with very limited graphics and certain features (namely Game History) are not implemented yet.

Currently I am on Sprint 2, Week 1 of 2 and in the process of creating a video of Sprint 1 outlining my Design and Development process so far. This will be a series posted on YouTube that will be on-going and evolve as the nature of the project does too.
