# Quarto

This project is currently in **Alpha** Development and is a personal passion project. Currently, I am working on this project alone to gain experience as a Product Designer and a Developer.

This project has no monetary intent and the code will be freely available to everyone for the foreseeable future.

I'm really excited to be working on this project and hope to see a few features be added over time.

Currently, local play seems to be "working". At the time of this writing "working" means that you can run this on your local machine and play multiple rounds. Data is no persistent beyond the current session, refreshing will lose your data. I have considered using LocalStorage to hold onto scores, my reasoning for not hasn't been fully explored but I bet it has to do with my last experience with it was when I was working on backend systems and had a habit to avoid LocalStorage.

v0.1a was released at the end of Sprint 2 (11/15/20) and announced the next day. Sprint 3's objectives are currently being chosen.
