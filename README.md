# What this project is

This project was an exercise and translating a physical board game into a digital one.

It is *not maintained* and *should not be ran* primarily due to vulnerabilities that have cropped up in old libraries.

This is the second or third time that I have recreated the game, but I wanted to try out React for light game development.

I wish I would have grabbed screenshots to place in the README but alas I don't think to document my projects outside of work.
